    *  Spatial Search
    *  Tile-rendering
  * Path finding algorithms
    * Depth First Search
    * Breadth First Search
    * Dijkstra's Algorithm
    * A* Path Finding
  * The Traveling Courier Problem (TSP variant)
    * Greedy Algorithm
    * 2-opt Perturbation Algorithm
    * 2.5-opt Perturbation ALgorithm
    * Simulated Annealing
* User Interface Implementation
  * Designed part of the UI (Favorite List, Toolbox, Direction Window, etc.)  
  * Used glade to aid UI development
  * Written callback functions to all UI elements
* Project Management
  * Utilize agile software development
